# Project Evaluation Tool
## Introduction
This application is designed to assist teachers in assessing the
submitted work of students. The system can be used for any type of
lessons. But the original requirements are based on the products of
Computer Science students.

Let's say that a project has a number of requirements that can be
graded/rewarded. Those requirements can be freely assigned to each
project. Some projects have a few of these, but the list CAN be very
long. (There is going to be some action that allows teachers to define
a template that can be used to create a copy for each new project.)

Various requirements can also be graded differently. 
* No/Yes (0 or 1 point)
* No/Somewhat/Good (0 to 2 points)
* No/Incomplete/Adequate/Good (0 to 3 points)
* Percentage from 0 to 100
* Grade from 1 to 10

Finally each project requirement has a weight. So that when all the
awarded points are summed and weighted an automatically calculated 
grade is provided.
